# REST-API-with-nodejs

## Introduction

**This API is to create a trip cost calculator app.**

Also It will expose a set of GET and POST endpoints to allow getting data out, and sending data in.
I’ll use a MongoDB database to store this data.

## Description

Imagine going on a trip, and you have your app (which can be a progressive web app, or a mobile app for example) where you add any expense you make. Gasoline, hotels, food, tickets and so on.

When the trip ends, you archive it and it becomes part of the history - which you can navigate and see how much you spent in the past trips.

**I’am not going to create the frontend of the application here, just the API.**
